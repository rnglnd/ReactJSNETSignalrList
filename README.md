# ReactJSNETSignalrList

A sample MVC project using ReactJS.NET and Signalr. Also with Google Maps V3.

When I was looking to use all these technologies together I found very little to no examples online. So I hope this helps someone who's in a similar position to where I was.

This is also a sample so it gives a basic structure, it is very MVC focused as there's two different views and data passed between them. I have no db or storage connected up so the data does no persist but if you were using this in an ASP.NET MVC project that would be pretty easy to do. I've also kept the styles and everything as vanilla as possible so to help, and not to confuse, as many people as possible.
